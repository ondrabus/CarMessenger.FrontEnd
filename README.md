This is a front-end implementation of the CarMessenger.app project.


## How it works

This application features the front-end of CarMessenger. It connects to [CarMessenger.BackEnd](https://github.com/ondrabus/CarMessenger.BackEnd) project to get messages based on a license plate and a country code the visitors puts in.

Make sure to add a .env file with BACKEND_BASE_URI value:

```bash
BACKEND_BASE_URI=https://localhost:44316
```

To run the app simply execute:

```bash
npm run dev
```

And open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
